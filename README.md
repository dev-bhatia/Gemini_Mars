# :rocket: International Gemini Mars Design Competition
#### A couple of my peers and I participated in this collegiate level competition hosted by The Mars Society during our Junior/Senior year of high school.

#### We were all Project Lead the Way students taking an Aerospace Engineering course at the time, and wanted to challenge ourselves.

#### Ultimately, we made it to the final round - Top 10 in the World! :smile:

#### Check out our team's [Report (PDF)](Report.pdf) that got us that far!

## :clipboard: Competition Requirements  
#### "The requirement is to design a two-person Mars flyby mission that can be launched no later than 2024 as cheaply, safely and simply as possible. All other design variables are open."
