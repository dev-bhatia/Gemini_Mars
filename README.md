# :rocket: International Gemini Mars Design Competition

A couple of my peers and I participated in this collegiate level competition hosted by The Mars Society during our Junior/Senior year of high school. Ultimately, we made it to the final round - Top 10 in the World!

## Competition Requirements

"The requirement is to design a two-person Mars flyby mission that can be launched no later than 2024 as cheaply, safely and simply as possible. All other design variables are open."
